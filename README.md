# React Employee Directory

## An employee directory that displays nonsensitive employee data and allows the user to sort and search by name. Built with React. 

This application was built in order to familiarize myself with React and less so to work with actual employee data. As such, all employees are pulled from a randomuser API. That said, this application could be adapted with a database of actual employees in the future. 

## Installation 

To modify the code to suit your purposes, you can use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

To run the application on your local machine, you must install the dependencies listed in the package.json file. To do this, you can run `npm install` from your terminal. 

## Usage 

To use this application, follow the link on the repository page; otherwise, you can [click here](https://reactappemployeedirectory.herokuapp.com/).

On page load, 200 random employees will be retrieved from the API and displayed on the page. 

If you wish to search for an employee by name, simply type the employee's name in the search bar. You can sort the employees by name by pressing the arrow next to the "name" header. 

To clear any search values or filter options, press the "clear" button. 

## Credits 

In addition to [React](https://reactjs.org/), this application was also built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). Random employee data generated with the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/).
